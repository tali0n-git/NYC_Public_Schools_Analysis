# NYC Public School Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Geospatial Performance Analysis** of New York City Public Schools' performance data, primarily focusing on historical **Quality Review (QR) Ratings**.

The core objective is to investigate the relationship between school performance (over time) in different **geographic groupings** (ZIP Codes, Census Tracts, and Administrative Districts) against MTA/public transport survey data, to investigate any possible correlations.

## Process Steps:
1. Create EDA notebooks of school QR ratings.

2. Cleaned school location and QR data will be displayed in Tableau, using an interactive set of bar graphs to show how QR ratings in each borough's grouped locations change over time.

3. Begin a new repo for processing and repeating this process with MTA survey data.
